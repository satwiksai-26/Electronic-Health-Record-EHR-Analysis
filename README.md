# Electronic-Health-Record-EHR-Analysis
The key feature of this project will be the analysis of the EHR data for insight into the patient's cycle of care. We would like to find data patterns around who the patients are, what they have been diagnosed with, what kind of treatments have been given to them, and how the final outcome will be. The aim is to utilize these insights to further improve the delivery of health services and facilitate doctors towards making better choices, while encouraging further research in this direction.

I did this in Python, the modern day very popular programming language, backed up with some of the most powerful tools available: Pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and Matplotlib. These libraries were crucial for processing the data.

The dataset with which we were dealing was quite big: 31 different tables filled with pieces of information about patients. First of all, we cleaned the data in order to make the records all correct and homogenous. That step was particularly important since even a tiniest mistake might lead to some bias in our results.

With the cleaned data, we did something called feature engineering. We created new variables or transformed the existing ones such that the data would be more useful to us for analysis. In other words, it's like molding the data in a form such that important patterns can be easily identified.

Afterwards, we used descriptive statistics to summarize the data and thus grab something about the trends and the distribution of data. We have mainly used such visualizations as charts, graphs, and plots in presenting these findings so that one glance tells anyone what the data is stating.

Finally, hypothesis testing allowed us to verify whether the things that we are observing are actually robustly consistent. It's a confirmation of whether the patterns that we observe are actual, or if it comes up just by chance. After all, the insights to be derived from such analysis may be very helpful to healthcare providers. It perhaps will help them make evidence-based decisions that would result in better patient outcomes. Similarly, the outcome of this project would form the basis on which other research work may be initiated, probably leading to innovation and improvement in health care.
